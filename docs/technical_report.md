## Abstract
This project explores the design and implementation of a lightweight log analysis tool written in Python for inspecting system logs generated by journalctl on Linux systems. The tool focuses on extracting, classifying, and summarizing log entries across extended time periods, with particular emphasis on identifying active processes and grouping messages by severity and functional domain. Rather than acting as a full log viewer, the analyzer aims to reduce noise by filtering low-priority messages and aggregating recurring events into concise, human-readable summaries. The project serves as a practical exercise in log parsing, data reduction, and system observability, highlighting both the limitations of text-based log formats and the importance of structured logging for reliable analysis.
